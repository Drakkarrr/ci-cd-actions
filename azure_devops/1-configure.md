# Configure credentials for GitHub Actions Importer

In this lab, you will use the `configure` CLI command to set the required credentials and information for GitHub Actions Importer to use when working with Azure DevOps and GitHub.

You will need to complete all of the setup instructions [here](./readme.md#configure-your-codespace) prior to performing this lab.

## Configuring credentials

1. Create an Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT).
      __Note__: you can skip this step if you still have the PAT created during the setup steps [here](./readme.md#bootstrap-your-azure-devops-organization).
      - Navigate to your existing organization (<https://dev.azure.com/:organization>) in your browser.
      - In the top right corner of your screen, click `User settings`.
      - Click `Personal access tokens`.
      - Select `+ New Token`
      - Name your token, select the organization where you want to use the token, and set your token to automatically expire after a set number of days.
      - Select the following scopes (you may need to `Show all scopes` to reveal all scopes):
         - Agents Pool: `Read`
         - Build: `Read & execute`
         - Code: `Read & write`
         - Project and Team: `Read, write, & manage`
         - Release: `Read`
         - Service Connections: `Read`
         - Task Groups: `Read`
         - Variable Groups: `Read`
      - Click `Create`.
      - Copy the generated API token and save it in a safe location.

2. Create a GitHub personal access token (PAT):
      - Open github.com in a new browser tab.
      - In the top right corner of the UI, click your profile photo and then click `Settings`.
      - In the left panel, click `Developer Settings`.
      - Click `Personal access tokens` and then `Tokens (classic)` (if present).
      - Click `Generate new token` and then `Generate new token (classic)`. You may be required to authenticate with GitHub during this step.
      - Name your token in the `Note` field.
      - Select the following scope: `workflow`.
      - Click `Generate token`.
      - Copy the generated PAT and save it in a safe location.

3. Run the `configure` CLI command:
      - Select the `TERMINAL` tab from within the codespace terminal.
      - Run the following command: `gh actions-importer configure`.
      - Use the down arrow key to highlight `Azure DevOps`, press the spacebar to select, and then press enter to continue.
      - At the GitHub PAT prompt, enter the GitHub PAT generated in step 2 and press enter.
      - At the GitHub URL prompt, enter the GitHub instance URL or press enter to accept the default value (`https://github.com`).
      - At the Azure DevOps token prompt, enter the access token from step 1 and press enter.
      - At the Azure DevOps URL prompt, enter your Azure DevOps URL or press enter to accept the default value (`https://dev.azure.com`).
      - At the prompt, enter your Azure DevOps organization name. This should be the same organization used in the setup steps [here](./readme.md#bootstrap-your-azure-devops-organization).
      - At the prompt, enter your Azure DevOps project name. This should be the same project name used in the setup steps [here](./readme.md#bootstrap-your-azure-devops-organization).

         ```console
         $ gh actions-importer configure
         ✔ Which CI providers are you configuring?: Azure DevOps
         Enter the following values (leave empty to omit):
         ✔ Personal access token for GitHub: ***************
         ✔ Base url of the GitHub instance: https://github.com
         ✔ Personal access token for Azure DevOps: ***************
         ✔ Base url of the Azure DevOps instance: https://dev.azure.com
         ✔ Azure DevOps organization name: :organization
         ✔ Azure DevOps project name: :project
         Environment variables successfully updated.
         ```

## Verify your environment

To verify your environment is configured correctly, run the `update` CLI command. The `update` CLI command will download the latest version of GitHub Actions Importer to your codespace.

1. In the codespace terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   gh actions-importer update
   ```

2. You should see a confirmation that you were logged into the GitHub Container Registry and the image was updated to the latest version.

   ```console
   $ gh actions-importer update
   Login Succeeded
   latest: Pulling from actions-importer/cli
   Digest: sha256:a7d00dee8a37e25da59daeed44b1543f476b00fa2c41c47f48deeaf34a215bbb
   Status: Image is up to date for ghcr.io/actions-importer/cli:latest
   ghcr.io/actions-importer/cli:latest
   ```
