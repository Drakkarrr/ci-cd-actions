# Perform a dry-run migration of a Jenkins pipeline

In this lab you will use the `dry-run` command to convert a Jenkins pipeline to its equivalent GitHub Actions workflow.

## Prerequisites

1. Followed the steps [here](./readme.md#configure-your-codespace) to set up your GitHub Codespaces environment and start a Jenkins server.
2. Completed the [configure lab](./1-configure.md#configuring-credentials).
3. Completed the [audit lab](./2-audit.md).

## Perform a dry run

You will be performing a dry run against a pipeline in your preconfigured Jenkins server. Answer the following questions before running this command:

1. What is the name of the pipeline you want to convert?
    - __test_pipeline__

2. What is the URL of the pipeline you want to convert?
    - __<http://localhost:8080/job/test_pipeline>__

3. Where do you want to store the result?
    - __tmp/dry-run__. This can be any path within the working directory from which GitHub Actions Importer commands are executed.

### Steps

1. Navigate to your codespace terminal.
2. Run the following command from the root directory:

    ```bash
    gh actions-importer dry-run jenkins --source-url http://localhost:8080/job/test_pipeline --output-dir tmp/dry-run
    ```

3. The command will list all the files written to disk when the command succeeds.

    ```console
    $ gh actions-importer dry-run jenkins --source-url http://localhost:8080/job/test_pipeline --output-dir tmp/dry-run
    [2022-09-28 20:12:00] Logs: 'tmp/dry-run/log/actions-importer-20220928-201200.log'
    [2022-09-28 20:12:00] Output file(s):
    [2022-09-28 20:12:00]   tmp/dry-run/test_pipeline/.github/workflows/test_pipeline.yml
    ```

4. View the converted workflow:
    - Find `tmp/dry-run/test_pipeline/.github/workflows` in the file explorer pane in your codespace.
    - Click `test_pipeline.yml` to open.

## Inspect the output files

The files generated from the `dry-run` command represent the equivalent Actions workflow for the given Jenkins pipeline. The Jenkins pipeline and converted workflow can be seen below:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        label 'TeamARunner'
    }

    environment {
        DISABLE_AUTH = 'true'
        DB_ENGINE    = 'sqlite'
    }

    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                echo "Database engine is ${DB_ENGINE}"
                sleep 80
                echo "DISABLE_AUTH is ${DISABLE_AUTH}"
            }
        }
        stage('test') {
            steps{
                junit '**/target/*.xml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```yaml

  - cron: 0-29/10 * * * *
env:
  DISABLE_AUTH: 'true'

    steps:
    - name: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: echo message
      run: echo "Database engine is ${{ env.DB_ENGINE }}"
#     # This item has no matching transformer
#     - sleep:
#       - key: time
#         value:
#           isLiteral: true
#           value: 80
    - name: echo message
      run: echo "DISABLE_AUTH is ${{ env.DISABLE_AUTH }}"
  test:
    runs-on:
      - self-hosted
      - TeamARunner
    needs: build
    steps:
    - name: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Publish test results
      uses: EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v1.7
      if: always()
      with:
        files: "**/target/*.xml"
```

These two pipelines function equivalently despite using different syntax. In this case, the pipeline conversion was ‚Äúpartially successful‚Äù (that is, some item[s] were not automatically converted) and the unconverted item was placed as comment in the location the Jenkins pipeline used it. For example:

```diff
- sleep 80
+ #     # This item has no matching transformer
+ #     - sleep:
+ #       - key: time
+ #         value:
+ #           isLiteral: true
+ #           value: 80
```

In the next lab, you'll learn how to override GitHub Actions Importer's default behavior and customize the converted workflow that is generated.

Try running the `dry-run` command for different pipelines in the Jenkins server. As a hint, you only have to change the `--source-url` CLI option.
